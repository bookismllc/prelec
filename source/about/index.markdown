###History and Mission
The **Antonija Prelec Memorial Fund** was established in honor of Antonija (Toni) Prelec by her family, friends and colleagues at the Health Sciences Center (HSC) of Stony Brook University. The purpose of the fund is to continue Toni's pursuit of excellence in medical librarianship and to improve the information services provided by the HSC Library.

 The Endowment provides grants for an annual visit and lecture by the Antonija Prelec Visiting Scholar, selected for his or her expertise in medical librarianship and information sciences. Income from the Fund also supports visits by HSC librarians to other medical libraries and attendance at conferences. Furthermore, aiming to encourage collaborations and exchanges with medical libraries thorughtout the world, the Fund can support visits by chosen librarians to the HSC Library.
